# Pizza-Maker-GUI-using-Java-Swings

## Abstract
Our Project is to make a software/program for shops which make pizza i.e. inventory for pizza maker. Hence forth the Title, "Pizza Maker".
This software works in a very simple and user-friendly manner.
The program first accepts the pizza order from the customer, as they desire their pizza to be i.e. The customer is given option to choose the:
  1.  Crust of Pizza.
  2.  Type of pizza (i.e. Vegetarian or Non-Vegetarian).
  3.  Veggies.
  4.  Finally to place order.

After selection of the required options and confirmation of the order, the order summary is also displayed.

## Problem Statement
1.  To take various input and display them accordingly.
2.  To create software/program using Java and GUI, which works as an inventory for a pizza shop.
3.  To create a software/program which simply takes pizza’s composition as input and displays order summary as output.

## Conclusion
1.  The software/program is running successfully.
2.  Each and every button is functioning as coded.

## Future Scope
1.  This software/program can be used in any shop to take multiple order, if made changes in the code accordingly.
2.  By updating its GUI, it can be made more interactive.
3.  By adding some calculative tools in the software, it can also help the user to do the calculation of the order placed.
